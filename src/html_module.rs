//TODO: I received a warning that soup is going to be incompatible in a future version, as it uses an old version of html5ever.
/*Possible solutions:
 - Convert to html5ever
 - find alternative library/framework
 - convert html module to python script, use python version of soup
 - convert html by hand(absolutely not)
