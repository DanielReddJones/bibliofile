### A TUI-based ebook reader that hopefully doesn't suck!

A long long time ago, I was in college. I frequently bought the ebook versions of my textbooks, but to my dismay...most ebook readers sucked. The user interface was complicated, dark mode was unavailable for most readers until I neared graduation, dark mode usually looked terrible even if it was available, etc. I hope to change that. What better dark mode that running it on the TUI? What better way to make a simple UI than to design one myself that *I* like?

This is very much a personal project. Rust isn't exactly used for big companies besides Mozilla just yet, and progress is slow-going due to my personal and work commitments. Still, when it is done, I will attempt to release it on several popular repositories such as Flatpack so that others can use it.

Feel free to check up on progress on my blog, www.whoisthisjoker.com. I post there periodically to talk about what direction I want the project to go.
